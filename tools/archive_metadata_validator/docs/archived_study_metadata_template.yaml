#
# This is a template for the archived study metadata form. You can use this to
# enter metadata about your study.
# Please read the Archived Study Metadata Handbook, ca. 15 minutes reading time,
# for a more detailed explanation of this form.
#
# If you do not wish to read to handbook now, here is a short description of
# this file.
#
# Generally information is entered by specifying an element name followed by a
# colon and a space and then the content. For example:
#
#     name: An Important Study
#
# defines the element "name" with the content "An Important Study" (as demonstrated
# in the "purpose"-element below, text can also span multiple lines).
#
# All example text is surrounded with <ex> and </ex>. Please replace the example
# text including the <ex> and </ex> with your data. For example, replace
#
#      name: <ex>Name of study</ex>
#
# with
#
#      name: Intelligence in Rodents
#
# if the name of your study is "Intelligence in Rodents".
#
# An element might contain another element. This is indicated by indenting the
# contained element. For example:
#
#    study:
#        name: A name
#        start_date: 1.1.2020
#
# defines an element named study that contains itself two elements, i.e.
# the element "name" with the content "A name", and the element "start_date"
# with the content "1.1.2020".
#
# In addition to named elements there are lists. Lists have a name and their
# contained elements are indented and preceded by a "-". For example:
#
#     keywords:
#        - Rodents
#        - Navigation
#
# defines a list named "keywords" with two entries, i.e. "Rodents", and
# "Navigation". Lists in this template contain only one or two entries for
# demonstration purposes. You can extend lists with additional elements or delete
# elements from the list, but you can not create empty lists. If you do not want,
# in this example, to specify keywords, just delete the line with "keywords:" and
# all list entries, i.e. the lines with "Rodents" and with "Navigation".
#
# Generally if you want to delete an element you have to delete the contained elements
# as well, that means everything that is indented. For example, if you delete "b" from
# the following:
#
#     a: example text
#     b:
#        b1: more example text
#        b2: even more example text
#     c:
#        c1: text example
#
# you end up with:
#
#     a: example text
#     c:
#        c1: text example
#
# and if you want to delete "a" from the above document, you end up with:
#
#     c:
#        c1: text example
#
# You do not have to enter information for all elements. Most elements are optional
# and can be deleted.  Comments indicate which element is optional and can be deleted.
#
# One last note: content that contains a colon followed by space, e. g. Tel: +49 1 555333
# has to be enclosed in double quotes like this: "Tel: +49 1 555333". There is an
# example below in "additional_contact_information".
